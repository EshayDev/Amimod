## Features

### Bundle Support & Discovery
- Support for apps, VSTs, AudioUnits, frameworks, system extensions, and more
- Intelligent executable discovery that recursively scans MacOS, Frameworks, and LaunchServices directories
- Clean dropdown interface showing all available executables

### Advanced Patching Capabilities
- Multi-pattern patching - apply multiple hex patches in sequence
- Intelligent wildcard support using `??` - perfect for version-resilient patches across app updates
- Batch hex notes import in standard MSJ format
- Multiple match handling with confirmation prompts (up to 50,000 matches per pattern)

### Performance & Reliability
- SIMD-optimized Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm for lightning-fast searching
- Multi-threading with parallel chunk processing
- Can patch a 250MB binary in ~25ms while using max 50MB memory
- Built-in benchmarking tools with visual results
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed context

### User Experience
- Real-time progress tracking with timing information
- Intuitive interface designed for both beginners and experts
- Extensive validation to prevent data corruption

## Installation

### Using the Latest Release

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/EshayDev/Amimod/releases/latest)
2. Mount the DMG file
3. Drag `Amimod.app` to your Applications folder

### Compiling from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EshayDev/Amimod.git
cd Amimod
# Open Amimod.xcodeproj in Xcode
# Build and archive the Amimod target
# Copy Amimod.app to /Applications
```

## Usage

### Selecting a Bundle

1. Launch Amimod
2. Click **"Select Bundle"** to choose a target file
3. Supported formats: `.app`, `.component`, `.audiounit`, `.vst`, `.vst3`, `.framework`, `.bundle`, `.kext`, `.appex`
4. Select an executable from the dropdown list

### Manual Hex Patching

1. **Find Hex:** Enter the pattern to search for (eg. `48 89 E5 41 57`)
2. **Replace Hex:** Enter the replacement pattern (eg. `90 90 90 90 90`)
3. Click **"Patch Hex"** to apply

### Wildcard Usage

Amimod's wildcard system is designed for creating patches that survive app updates:

**Scenario 1: App updated but you know the target pattern**
```
Find:    48 89 ?? 5D C3    // Middle byte might have changed between versions
Replace: 90 90 90 90 90    // But we know exactly what we want to patch it to
```

**Scenario 2: Preserving variable data while modifying surrounding code**
```
Find:    48 8B ?? ?? ?? ?? 89    // Keep the middle 4 bytes intact
Replace: 48 8B ?? ?? ?? ?? 90    // Only change the last instruction
```

This makes it easy to create generic patches that work across multiple app versions, automatically adapting to slight changes in assembly code while preserving critical variable data.

### Multiple Matches

When multiple matches are found:
- Shows match count before applying
- Asks for confirmation
- Limits to 50,000 matches per pattern to prevent performance issues

### Batch Hex Notes

Import multiple patches using this format:

```
<find hex pattern>
to
<replace hex pattern>
```

**Example:**
```
x86_64:

31 C0 ?? ?? C3
to
31 C0 90 90 C3

ARM64:

?? ?? 80 52 C0 03 5F D6
to
20 00 80 52 C0 03 5F D6
```

**To import:**
1. Click the Import button (üì•) in the toolbar
2. Paste hex notes into the editor
3. Click "Import" to load and validate patches
4. Click "Patch Hex" to apply all patches

## Benchmarking

The built-in benchmark tests patching performance across different scenarios:

1. Click the Speedometer icon (‚è±Ô∏è) in the toolbar
2. Tests pattern sizes from 8 to 256 bytes
3. Tests with and without wildcards
4. View results as charts or tables

## Performance Features

- **SIMD Instructions:** Uses 16-bit and 32-bit SIMD for faster searching
- **Boyer-Moore-Horspool:** Optimized string searching algorithm
- **Multi-threading:** Parallel processing across CPU cores
- **Chunk Management:** Dynamic sizing based on file size
- **Memory Efficiency:** Handles large files without excessive RAM usage

## System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| OS | macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later |
| Architecture | Intel x86_64 or Apple Silicon |
| Memory | 4GB RAM minimum |
| Storage | 30MB free space |

## Important Notes

- Amimod focuses purely on hex patching - it doesn't handle codesigning
- For codesigning after patching, consider using [Sentinel](https://itsalin.com/appInfo/?id=sentinel) or standard terminal commands
- The tool is provided free of charge under MIT license
