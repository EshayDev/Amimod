## Features

### Bundle Support & Discovery
- Support for apps, VSTs, AudioUnits, frameworks, system extensions, and more
- Recursively scans `Contents/MacOS`, `Contents/Frameworks`, and `Contents/Library/LaunchServices`
- Dropdown interface listing all discovered Mach-O executables

### Advanced Patching Capabilities
- Multi-pattern patching - apply multiple hex patches in sequence
- Intelligent wildcard support using `??` - perfect for version-resilient patches across app updates
- Batch hex notes import in standard MSJ format
- Multiple match handling with confirmation prompts (up to 50,000 matches per pattern)

### Performance & Reliability
- Parallel chunk processing across CPU cores
- Efficient byte searching using libc primitives (memchr/memcmp) with anchored checks
- Dynamic chunk sizing and overlap management to avoid missed matches
- Built-in benchmarking UI with chart and table views
- Clear error messages and input validation

### Polished UX
- Real-time status for patching/benchmarking
- Toolbar actions for music toggle, import hex notes, and benchmarking
- Optional background music (toggle via the speaker icon)

## Installation

### Using the Latest Release

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/EshayDev/Amimod/releases/latest)
2. Mount the DMG file
3. Drag `Amimod.app` to your Applications folder

### Compiling from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EshayDev/Amimod.git
cd Amimod
# Open Amimod.xcodeproj in Xcode
# Build and archive the Amimod target
# Copy Amimod.app to /Applications
```

## Usage

### Selecting a Bundle

1. Launch Amimod
2. Click "Select Bundle" and choose a target bundle
3. Supported: `.app`, `.component`, `.audiounit`, `.vst`, `.vst3`, `.framework`, `.bundle`, `.kext`, `.appex`
4. Pick an executable from the dropdown

### Manual Hex Patching

1. **Find Hex:** Enter the pattern to search for (eg. `48 89 E5 41 57`)
2. **Replace Hex:** Enter the replacement pattern (eg. `90 90 90 90 90`)
3. Click **"Patch Hex"** to apply

### Wildcard Usage

Amimod's wildcard system is designed for creating patches that survive app updates:

**Scenario 1: App updated but you know the target pattern**
```
Find:    48 89 ?? 5D C3    // Middle byte might have changed between versions
Replace: 90 90 90 90 90    // But we know exactly what we want to patch it to
```

**Scenario 2: Preserving variable data while modifying surrounding code**
```
Find:    48 8B ?? ?? ?? ?? 89    // Keep the middle 4 bytes intact
Replace: 48 8B ?? ?? ?? ?? 90    // Only change the last instruction
```

This makes it easy to create generic patches that work across multiple app versions, automatically adapting to slight changes in assembly code while preserving critical variable data.

### Multiple Matches

When multiple matches are found:
- Shows match count before applying
- Asks for confirmation

### Batch Hex Notes

Import multiple patches using this format:

```
<find hex pattern>
to
<replace hex pattern>
```

**Example:**
```
x86_64:

31 C0 ?? ?? C3
to
31 C0 90 90 C3

ARM64:

?? ?? 80 52 C0 03 5F D6
to
20 00 80 52 C0 03 5F D6
```

**To import:**
1. Click the Import button (ðŸ“¥) in the toolbar
2. Paste hex notes into the editor
3. Click "Import" to load and validate patches
4. Click "Patch Hex" to apply all patches

### Benchmarking
- Toolbar â†’ Speedometer â†’ runs tests across pattern sizes (8â€“256 bytes) with/without wildcards
- Results can be viewed as a table or chart

## Safety & Limitations
- Patching is in-place. Always work on a copy and keep backups
- Code signing is not handled by Amimod. Re-sign externally if needed
- Replace and Find patterns must be the same length
- Too many matches (> 50,000 per pattern) are rejected for safety and performance
- Executable discovery only scans the bundle locations listed above

## System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| OS | macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later |
| Architecture | Intel (x86_64) or Apple Silicon (ARM64)|
| Memory | 4GB RAM recommended |
| Storage | 10MB free space |
